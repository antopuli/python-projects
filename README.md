# My Python Projects

In this repository you can find some easy and small projects I made using Python programming language. I'm studying Python in my academic path, my school privides the access to the [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/courses/programming), a learning platform managed by Cisco Systems that delivers courses in the fields of Cybersecurity, Networking, OS and Computer Programming. These projects come from the [Python Essentials](https://www.netacad.com/courses/programming/pcap-programming-essentials-python) course and my teachers asignments.

| [Tic Tac Toe](#cli-tic-tac-toe) | You can play a command line interface based Tic Tac Toe

In the next paragraphs I will explain to you the programming techniques I used to realize these projects, the concepts, modules and other informations directly viewing the code blocks.
